### Introduction <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

With these special, stressful times and there being so much going on, it is important to remember to be mindful of our mental and physical health. Restrictions on travel have affected families' usual visits to other family members especially the elderly, emphasizing these hard times. A research article found how isolation at home due to the pandemic may cause changes in an elderly’s habits and thus induce feelings of fear and anxiety ([Perrotta 2020](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01631-y&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1622582543016000&usg=AOvVaw3KveBy4w4DobU6Rorunc4T)). As a result, to incorporate the idea of improving the well-being of senior citizens, I centralized my project around the elderly's point-of-view and how to improve their well-being through meditation exercises and clearing misinformation of health-related issues with articles.

### Design Statement <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

<p align="center">
Specifically, how can we create a platform tailoring to the elderly population so that it is easy to use and navigate?
</p>

<p align="center">・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・・</p>

The purpose of my project is to allow senior citizens a more accessible, easy-to-use application showing how to meditate, decompress, and live a healthier life which is definitely needed during these difficult, special times when individuals may feel alone. Additionally, there is a stigma in regards to mental health especially among the Asian American communities; I hope to also turn this idea of mental health to be less taboo. Teaching and reminding seniors how to properly take care of themselves mentally and physically without feeling ashamed will improve their overall well-being.

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%2010.15.41%20PM.png" width="600 px"></div>
  
I analyzed two different forms of wellness related platforms, in particular, an iPad app called *Mindful Living Network* and a website called *Mindful*. Both though did not possess the most ideal features for user control, consistent design, nor helped the user recover from error.  The website was more information-oriented with articles and many busy visuals. On the other hand, the Mindful Living application provides meditation videos in addition to podcasts, daily quotes, and relevant articles.

To better assess the flaws and evaluate its functions to improve the user experience, a usability test was performed. This was done at my home out of convenience and due to current circumstances. This iPad app was chosen out of the two platforms I had performed heuristic evaluations on to perform the usability testing because it possessed a higher average in severity ratings overall. The usability testing involved three tasks which focused on navigating through all the video-related pages while deciphering certain buttons’ functions.

### User Research <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Some traditional solutions are simply hobbies like knitting and baking but there have been more meditation technological applications, such as Calm, made to address the issue of maintaining one’s mental health. Many may watch videos on platforms like YouTube but these applications themselves are not specifically geared towards senior citizens. With digital technology, streaming meditation videos and getting well-being tips can be centralized and more accessible on the go with the range of potential audiences also being much greater. The advanced technology such as AI and VR today can also be incorporated to create a more engaging and interactive experience. 

A quote from my participant:

"[T]he geriatric population aren't exactly technology inclined, and they're sometimes hard of hearing, or they can't see very well. So things need to be you know, visually, like larger or the sound needs to be louder for them to be able to use these platforms"

### UX Storytelling <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

From what I learned from my user interviews and research, some elderly may not favor going to the doctor so I focused on two *contrasting* personalities and views on healthcare but they possess the lack of technological experience. Pictured below is one of the two personas. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Christopher%20Persona.png" width="600 px"></div>

  
Nguyen is not the type of person to open up about his feelings nor health so faced many challenges on searching on the web for mental health resources but Be You allows him to effortlessly plan his health journey as a non-native English speaker with the reading guides and read health-related and specifically mental health and meditation articles without the hassle and effort of searching.

### Low-fidelity Prototype <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

My intial low-fidelity sketchs of the wireflow can be viewed below. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/sketch2.png" width="500 px"></div>
<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Wireflow%20draft.png" width="500 px"></div>

Considering what I learned from my user research and what struggles the elderly may currently face when trying to improve their well-being, I focused the main features of the low-fidelity on the following topics: 

* Settings to select language preference: this then enables many non-native elderly individuals to understand content
* Filter option for searching meditation videos: categories in addition to the ability of searching with any keywords
* Accessible video settings: adjusting volume, saving videos, skipping to a certain part of the video
* Articles with filter options 

When performing user testing with the low-fidelity prototype, it was interesting being able to physically see how the user would interact with the content of the application without taking into account any design measures. I do admit this was partly a setback because my participant was frequently bothered by the lack of color. I realized how some of the comments made by my user aligns with what we learned when performing a heuristic evaluation. For example, users want a sign of confirmation and should not be guessing certain actions. To have a seamless workflow, users should have cues and actions should be as effortless as possible by not requiring them to really remember information but rather easily recognize common elements. Through this, I was able to take note of several methods to tackle the visual design as the user expected certain cues to have happened or to have been included such as how reflection articles were sorted should be clearer to how when exactly these should sorted ie after they press a filter option or after confirming somehow.

### Graphic Design Element Variation <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Performing some outside research on which fonts are best for the elderly population, I found that it was best to have at least a 12 point font and not use any fonts that were extra fancy in any way ([Health Literacy 2016](https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/display/section-3-3/)). As a result, I settled on the Open Sans font and all words on the app are *at least 30 point* font size. 

I originally wanted to use a warm orange color for the background of all the screens but white font on an orange background failed the color contrast test as displayed in the image. Instead, green was used for the background because I found that the color green is associated with being restful and healthy and is easier on the eyes ([Mark@ElderTech 2017](https://eldertech.org/color-in-designing-technology-for-seniors/)). 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/orange%20color%20contrast.png" width="500 px"></div>

The color contrasts tests showed that green in combination with a peach color, pale yellow, and white met all the levels of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, including the high level WCAG AAA. Considering that my user would be a senior citizen, meeting this condition is essential.

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/green%20orange%20color%20contrast.png" width="350 px"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/white%20green%20color%20contrast.png" width="350 px">

When playing around with light versus dark modes, I found it better to use the HSL option in Figma to adjust the lightness and get the dark mode not as dark that it appears black as seen by the third set of screens in the left photo below. As for spacing, I made sure all headings were consistent and after the 100 px from the top edge of the screen unless there was a symbol such as the back icon on the screen.

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/dark%20mode.png" width="600 px"></div>

The picture below illustrates the basic outline of the color scheme I chose, the font types used as well as several inactive and active button states and the minimum size of icons used.

### Initial Prototype <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

The prototype draft supports the following tasks:

* Changing Language Preference (ie from Spanish to English)
* Watching a meditation video (access the volume settings, adding captions)
* Saving a meditation video
* Filtering Reflection Articles by Author

### Impression Test <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Overall, I received positive feedback from my classmates who were able to identify the main purposes of the app. I did get a suggestion to provide an unsave button when users save a meditation video so to make it clearer to the user that all they had to do to unsave the video was click on the bookmark again, I decided to then display the saved video differently so that when the user lands on the Meditation video page, instead of a filled bookmark, there is a clearly displayed “Unsave” button. I also ended up adding some more space for the Meditation video page so that it was not too crowded between the button to see all saved videos and the heading “Recently Uploaded.” Lastly, I added a page to show the color change of the Home button when clicked on. The revised design can be viewed below.

### Interactive Prototype <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Making the necessary changes after the impression test, I centralized my high fidelity mockup to support the following tasks:

1) Changing language preference

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Lang%20Preference%20Task.png" width="600 px"></div>


2) Finding meditation video, accessing its settings, and saving the video

### Cognitive Walkthrough <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

I first performed a cognitive walthrough with my sister. During the walkthrough with my sister, she ended up not reaching all the screens because one of the screens was not connected. After this was fixed, I was able to gain feedback on some suggestions to improve the interactions including making a separate volume state to illustrate an adjustment to the volume.

I then ran through my prototype with a few of my classmates who overall liked the color palette and simplicity. They suggested adding more labels to the back arrow and the filter for the Reflection articles page and adding a filler message to the search bar. Consequently, I edited all the back arrows as such, added a label to the filter icon, and provided a filler message within the search bar on the Meditation page to clarify how videos are being presented.

### Further Usability Testing <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Written responses of the session can be viewed [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17WglkT1YAJFP9OdAA5nHIz2sUgvsbYLV4YAsfOTTMcI/edit?usp=sharing)

My participant of this testing phase shared the following items that could improved:

- Words slightly not centered on Home Page
- No authors listed on Reflection articles page

She expected the volume settings to slide but for the purposes of the prototype, I wanted participants to be able to access the volume settings in a timely manner. It was also interesting that she noted the green to be a color that does not go well with red for color contrast but after the session, informing her of my evidence of color contrast and how no red is used as a background for this green or on this green reassured her how this would be elderly friendly. She overall liked the large font and suggested moving the titles of the buttons a bit on the Home Page and showing the authors of the articles. 
Iterating on my design, I added author names to the Reflection articles page, ensured the heading on buttons were centered, and included at least a prominent difference in volume settings to indicate a lower volume.

### Conclusion <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

* Design is an iterative process.

The whole process from ideating to creating was an enojyable process and I loved learning and experimenting with Figma. For instance, after receiving feedback based on the first and second cognitive run throughs, I further edited the prototype accordingly. Other suggestion would also come to me after user interviews that may not have been mentioned during the interviews but were influenced by what I observed. I found it easier to edit my prototype and connect my screens while I was previewing the prototype on another tab to see it work. For example, while editing the features and icons for the Meditation video, I was planning to overlay the component over the screen but while previewing the prototype after I made that change, the screen reached a dead end after the overlay. As a result, instead of using an overlay, I ended up duplicating and altering  certain aspects of the screen and adding that to the flow. This allowed me easier manipulation when connecting other screens to the flow as well.

* Make the user journey as intuitive and easy as possible.

During my usability tests, I found many relied on the visual changes in buttons as well as written notifications to move onto the next step. As a result, I had to ensure all buttons had a hovering state with a name of what that button was for. When an action was made, no matter how small including saving the settings, I had to make sure to include a distinct change to the save option with a written confirmation.

* Prototype with components.

 I learned several technical skills in regards to prototyping and prototyping with components was one of them. I was not able to utilize a lot of compoents due to having wireframed most of the screens before realizing making components would be more effective. Consequently, when designing in the future, I would want to plan out all buttons and their states ahead of time along with the general layout that will be consistently used. This would have speeded the process when editing the titles of the buttons so I would have to manually go in and edit each one for each screen.
