# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### Project Description

With these special, stressful times and there being so much going on, it is important to remember to be mindful of our mental and physical health. Restrictions on travel have affected families' usual visits to other family members especially the elderly, emphasizing these hard times. As a result, to incoporate the idea of improving the wel-being of senior citizens, I would love to centralize my project around the elderly's point-of-view and how to improve their well-being through meditation exercises or soothing music.
