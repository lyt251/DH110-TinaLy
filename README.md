### Introduction <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

With these special, stressful times and there being so much going on, it is important to remember to be mindful of our mental and physical health. Restrictions on travel have affected families' usual visits to other family members especially the elderly, emphasizing these hard times. A research article found how isolation at home due to the pandemic may cause changes in an elderly’s habits and thus induce feelings of fear and anxiety ([Perrotta 2020](https://www.google.com/url?q=https://doi.org/10.1007/s40520-020-01631-y&sa=D&source=editors&ust=1622582543016000&usg=AOvVaw3KveBy4w4DobU6Rorunc4T)). As a result, to incorporate the idea of improving the well-being of senior citizens, I centralized my project around the elderly's point-of-view and how to improve their well-being through meditation exercises and clearing misinformation of health-related issues with articles.

### Design Statement <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Specifically, how can we create a platform that tailors to the elderly population that is easy to use and navigate?
</p>

The purpose of my project is to allow senior citizens a more accessible, easy-to-use application showing how to meditate, decompress, and live a healthier life which is definitely needed during these difficult, special times when individuals may feel alone. Additionally, there is a stigma in regards to mental health especially among the Asian American communities; I hope to also turn this idea of mental health to be less taboo. Teaching and reminding seniors how to properly take care of themselves mentally and physically without feeling ashamed will improve their overall well-being.

### Competitor Analysis: Heuristic Evaluation <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

I analyzed two different forms of wellness related platforms, in particular, an iPad app called *Mindful Living Network* and a website called *Mindful*. Both though did not possess the most ideal features for user control, consistent design, nor helped the user recover from error.  The website was more information-oriented with articles and many busy visuals. On the other hand, the Mindful Living application provides meditation videos in addition to podcasts, daily quotes, and relevant articles.

To better assess the flaws and evaluate its functions to improve the user experience, a usability test was performed. This was done at my home out of convenience and due to current circumstances. This iPad app was chosen out of the two platforms I had performed heuristic evaluations on to perform the usability testing because it possessed a higher average in severity ratings overall. The usability testing involved three tasks which focused on navigating through all the video-related pages while deciphering certain buttons’ functions.

### User Research <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Some traditional solutions are simply hobbies like knitting and baking but there have been more meditation technological applications, such as Calm, made to address the issue of maintaining one’s mental health. Many may watch videos on platforms like YouTube but these applications themselves are not specifically geared towards senior citizens. With digital technology, streaming meditation videos and getting well-being tips can be centralized and more accessible on the go with the range of potential audiences also being much greater. The advanced technology such as AI and VR today can also be incorporated to create a more engaging and interactive experience.

"[T]he geriatric population aren't exactly technology inclined, and they're sometimes hard of hearing, or they can't see very well. So things need to be you know, visually, like larger or the sound needs to be louder for them to be able to use these platforms"

### UX Storytelling <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

From what I learned from my user interviews and research, some elderly may not favor going to the doctor so I focused on two *contrasting* personalities and views on healthcare but they possess the lack of technological experience. Pictured below is one of the two personas.

Nguyen is not the type of person to open up about his feelings nor health so faced many challenges on searching on the web for mental health resources but Be You allows him to plan his health journey with the reading guides and read health-related and specifically mental health and meditation articles without the hassle and effort of searching.

### Low-fidelity Prototype <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

My intial low-fidelity sketch of the wireflow can be viewed below. 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/sketch2.png" width="1000 px"></div>

Considering what I learned from my user research and what struggles the elderly may currently face when trying to improve their well-being, I focused the main features of the low-fidelity on the following topics: 

* Settings to select language preference: this then enables many non-native elderly individuals to understand content
* Filter option for searching meditation videos: categories in addition to the ability of searching with any keywords
* Accessible video settings: adjusting volume, saving videos, skipping to a certain part of the video
* Articles with filter options 

When performing user testing with the low-fidelity prototype, it was interesting being able to physically see how the user would interact with the content of the application without taking into account any design measures. I do admit this was partly a setback because my participant was frequently bothered by the lack of color. I realized how some of the comments made by my user aligns with what we learned when performing a heuristic evaluation. For example, users want a sign of confirmation and should not be guessing certain actions. To have a seamless workflow, users should have cues and actions should be as effortless as possible by not requiring them to really remember information but rather easily recognize common elements. Through this, I was able to take note of several methods to tackle the visual design as the user expected certain cues to have happened or to have been included such as how reflection articles were sorted should be clearer to how when exactly these should sorted ie after they press a filter option or after confirming somehow.

### Graphic Design Element Variation <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/Screen%20Shot%202021-06-01%20at%209.30.23%20PM.png" width="100 px">

Performing some outside research on which fonts are best for the elderly population, I found that it was best to have at least a 12 point font and not use any fonts that were extra fancy in any way ([Health Literacy 2016](https://health.gov/healthliteracyonline/display/section-3-3/)). As a result, I settled on the Open Sans font and all words on the app are **at least 30 point** font size. 

I originally wanted to use a warm orange color for the background of all the screens but white font on an orange background failed the color contrast test as displayed in the image. Instead, green was used for the background because I found that the color green is associated with being restful and healthy and is easier on the eyes ([Mark@ElderTech 2017](https://eldertech.org/color-in-designing-technology-for-seniors/). 

<div style="text-align:center"><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lyt251/DH110-TinaLy/main/orange%20color%20contrast.png" width="1000 px"></div>

The color contrasts tests showed that green in combination with a peach color, pale yellow, and white met all the levels of Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, including the high level WCAG AAA. Considering that my user would be a senior citizen, meeting this condition is essential.
