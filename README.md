# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 1: Heuristic Evaluation

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### Project Description 

With these special, stressful times and there being so much going on, it is important to remember to be mindful of our mental and physical health. Restrictions on travel have affected families' usual visits to other family members especially the elderly, emphasizing these hard times. As a result, to incoporate the idea of improving the wel-being of senior citizens, I would love to centralize my project around the elderly's point-of-view and how to improve their well-being through meditation exercises or soothing music.

Heuristic | Evaluation of App | Improvements (if applicable) | Sev. Rate
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Visibility of system status**: The application’s format and content allows the user to seamlessly navigate through it without unpredictable outcomes.| When trying to click on one of the videos under the Meditation Room, the app suddenly shuts down and exits. All other buttons are fine though and lead to the rights pages but the share quote made me think that I could also share my own quote. Also, the podcast has no clear details on how long the meditation or podcast video is. | This may be due to the lack of support as an app itself or more of a technical issue of which platform the founder of the app used to host the app. In regards to the quote, “SHARE QUOTE” can be “SHARE THE QUOTE” which then specifies that they are talking about the quote listed. As for the videos, the total length of the video should be shown as well as the current time while watching the video. | 3
**Match between system and real world**: Any icons, symbols, or pictures use are not foreign to the user; they are memorable and can easily be connected to real-life actions. | All symbols used for the bottom navigation bar of the app are recognizable but in some cases, such under the “Click here to see them all [meditation videos]” | Besides more stylistic of an issue which will be elaborated in the other heuristics, there is no big issue with the symbols. | 1 
**User control and freedom**: Users have the autonomy; they can, for example, ‘cancel’ an action. | All podcasts must be listened to on the tab with that podcast shown; there is no way to listen to the podcast while browsing other podcasts or even going on the other icons on the navigation bar. Additionally, there is only a start and stop button for the podcast. Back buttons are provided when clicking on the podcast and then wanting to go back to the page with all podcasts listed but after clicking on the “see another quote” on the main page, there is no one to go back on this action. | Provide more options for the video such as pause and play from the beginning instead of start. Have arrows on the main page to go from quote to quote. | 3
**Consistency and standards**: The design of the application overall has a common theme. | The buttons on the “Mindful Moment” and “ ‘Stress Less’ Tips” do not have consistent font nor button design. One button is rounded with italicized letters while the other not having either features. “SHARE QUOTE” button is also a button unlike the rest of the buttons, being grey with dark grey rather than white letters. The heading in the orange banner specifically for the Stress Tips is not consistent. Each tab kind of has its own theme of displaying information which makes the app messy. | Keep a consistent font system (type and size) for all pages; the main title and subtitle displayed on the ‘Mindful Moment’ can be the main good choice used for the rest of the pages. Make all clickable buttons the same type and design, either all rounded or not with the same color for the words. Since scenery videos are included for each ‘Meditation Room’ video, also include nature pictures for the podcasts. The picture for the ‘Stress Tips’ page has the image fill the page so do the same for the ‘Mindful Movement’ page. Provide a button consistent with the other buttons for the ‘see another tip’ and ‘share quote’. | 3
**Error prevention**: There exist features that guide the user through a specific process and reaffirms their actions. | As mentioned in heuristic #1, clicking on the ‘Meditation Room’ videos then disrupts the app and user flow. There are no affirmations or gestures after a click is made besides the subtle change in the podcast selected being grey after it is clicked on. | After clicking on “visit the Stress Institute website” or “Read More” button, there should be a warning that indicates the user will be exiting from the app. Being on the various pages and navigating through the icons on the navigation bar should be clear with the icon changing color depending on which page we are on. When “see another quote” is pressed on, perhaps include loading and a symbol to suggest the options of sharing the quote is taking a longer amount of time to load. | 3
**Recognition rather than recall**: Subtle cues and features that ease the mind of the user to not have to memorize anything. For example, having an accessible side-bar menu with labels. | Navigation bar is fixed and visible even when on different pages of the app. | Have the icons on the navigation bar be more responsive.| 2
**Flexibility and efficiency of use**: Provide shortcuts and variations of ways to further personalize their experience and complete a task to account for differences in abilities. | This aspect of being versatile to a user of any skill level is not really accounted for. | There should be an option for those watching the videos to slow it to perhaps half the normal speed or even twice the speed. | 3
**Aesthetic and minimalist design**: Focus on the important features and do not overcomplicate the design. | The design is pretty simplistic already although the words on the navigation menu may not be needed and may be considered excessive. | Although not a top priority, removing the words for the navigation menu would make the design simpler. | 2
**Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors**: Provide error messages that are clear and concise. | There are no error messages. | Error messages would not really be applicable in this case but with an addition of search bar to narrow the selection of podcasts or ‘Meditation Room’ videos, there would need to be an error message  along the lines of “Sorry, we could not find what you are looking for. Perhaps try ‘Calm music’ or a more general keyword” | 2
**Help and documentation**: Sometimes having further instructions for users to reference is a good idea. | There are good instructions provided when on the ‘Meditation Room’ tab with the option of seeing the full list. On the other hand, there was not much documentation or guidance after selecting a podcast. | Provide further details on how the podcast is watched only from that page and how exiting from the page would cause the time in which the video was stopped to be lost. | 2
