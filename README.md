# Project Title
## Tina Ly

### Introduction
With these special, stressful times and there being so much going on, it is important to remember to be mindful of our mental and physical health. Restrictions on travel have affected families' usual visits to other family members especially the elderly, emphasizing these hard times. As a result, to incorporate the idea of improving the well-being of senior citizens, I would love to centralize my project around the elderly's point-of-view and how to improve their well-being through meditation exercises or soothing music.

### Design Statement
The purpose of my project is to allow senior citizens a more accessible, easy-to-use application showing how to meditate, decompress, and live a healthier life which is definitely needed during these difficult, special times when individuals may feel alone. Additionally, there is a stigma in regards to mental health especially among the Asian American communities; I hope to also turn this idea of mental health to be less taboo. Teaching and reminding seniors how to properly take care of themselves mentally and physically without feeling ashamed will improve their overall well-being.
