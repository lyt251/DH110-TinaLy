# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Extra: Usability Testing

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### Introduction 

Be You is an app that builds and improves upon the features in the Mindful Living app. Since no well-known platform exists that focuses on the elderly population and improving their well-being, Be You provides meditation and simple to digest articles for senior citizens that tailors to the elderly population in its visual design. It uses color-blindness friendly color scheme, bigger font sizes, simple navigation buttons, and even allows for a language preference and provides a search and filter feature with categories. This prototyping phase helps highlight the aforementioned features that make the app unique.

### Methodology

I used my iPad to take notes and fill out the survey. The iPad's screen was sharing on the zoom call on the laptop while a laptop had the zoom call on one side of screen and the actual prototype on the other side of its screen. I used Quicktime to record the laptop screen and the session.

### Reflection 

My participant shared the following items that could improved:

- Words slightly not centered on Home Page
- No authors listed on Reflection articles page

She expected the volume settings to slide but for the purposes of the prototype, I wanted by partcipants to be able to access the volume settings in a timely matter. How she wanted to slide the volume settings though showed me (just like a couple other individuals who tried my prototype) that developers in this case would be advised to create a sliding effect. It was also interesting that she noted the green to be a color that does not go well with red for color contrast but after the session, informing her of my evidence of color contrast and how no red is used as a background for this green or on this green reassured her how this would be elderly friendly. She liked overall the large font and suggested moving the titles of the buttons a bit on the Home Page and showing the authors of the articles.
