# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 3: Contextual Inquiry

### Project Design Challenge ‚úèÔ∏è

#### Main Activity and Basic Need
The purpose of my project is to allow senior citizens a more accessible, easy-to use application showing how to meditate, decompress, and live a healthier life which is definitely needed during these difficult, special times when individuals may feel alone. Additionally, there is a stigma in regards to mental health especially among the Asian American communities; I hope to also turn this idea of mental health to be less taboo. Teaching and reminding seniors how to properly take care of themselves mentally and physically without feeling ashamed will improve their overall well-being. 

#### Solutions
Some traditional solutions are simply hobbies like knitting and baking but there have been more meditation technological applications, such as Calm, made to address the issue of maintaining one‚Äôs mental health. Many may watch videos on platforms like YouTube but these applications themselves though are not specifically geared towards senior citizens. 

#### Potential of Digital Technology
With digital technology, streaming meditation videos and getting well-being tips can be centralized and more accessible on the go with the range of potential audiences also being much greater. The advanced technology such as AI and VR today can also be incorporated to create a more engaging and interactive experience.

### Target Users üéØ
My users are senior citizens who may face various difficulties such as in seeing, remembering and hearing. They include anyone generally sixty years or older. The intended activity of my application is supposed to be done in their own homes or outside in a safe, quiet area. They meditate and destress through watching and interacting with videos and research articles.

### Research Methods üî¨
Unfortunately, my grandparents have passed away so I was unable to interview anyone who is an elder in my household so I decided to perform a contextual inquiry with my sister, who is a clinician working mainly with the elderly population and had her share her experiences and thoughts on meditation as well as her observations working with the elderly population. I then performed some research on my own in regards to the elderly population.

### Interesting Quotes/Facts üí¨

- "[T]he geriatric population aren't exactly technology inclined, and they're sometimes hard of hearing, or they can't see very well. So things need to be you know, visually, like larger or the sound needs to be louder for them to be able to use these platforms" (11:54)
- An issue is "getting the geriatric population or the elder to admit that they have no something wrong with their mental health, or there's way to improve it." (21:57)
- The elderly "are living in like, in a different view the current generation a little bit differently. They also come from a different background, different upbringing. So sometimes mental illnesses or mental health is, you know, stigmatized, so I'll be the first hurdle. The second hurdle is then finding ways to distress that works for them, for some of them is just going out and socializing with others. Sometimes it's using these apps and platforms, but they have to be elderly, friendly, they have to be something that one they can see in the first place" (21:57)
- "[T]he way to destress is very unique to individuals." (26:09)
- "In a recent study of ELSA with more than 11,000 participants, researchers found that both men and women who experienced increased levels of social isolation showed above-average memory decline within two years of the study" [(Adlakha 202)]("https://www.ias.ac.in/public/Resources/Articles_Repository/20210309_01.pdf")
- "Progressive muscle relaxation therapy and meditation therapy are effective alternative therapies for reducing both systolic and diastolic blood pressure."[(Mulyati 2021)]("https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/pvj-ishessh-20/125953714")
- "Meditation was associated with a _23% reduction_ in depressive symptoms" [(Igarashi 2020)]("https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13548506.2021.1871769?casa_token=a1jqw9b3whkAAAAA%3AL02qziHXDFEdcLMnCJgenag08-guPlt-fLCImulgYqOyC8x9aTrWptNc0y0wJc9RjPt_SVP92AarCQ")

### Reflection
Although I was not able to interview an elderly person, I was able to gain insight from my sister who has experience working with senior citizens; for instance, she made me realized that not only how the elderly population may have limited knowledge on technology, but also how some face dementia and Alzheimer‚Äôs disease. When performing mor research on this topic, it appears that many studies have been performed to explore how the elderly population have struggled with loneliness due to the pandemic's circumstances and tehir illnesses add another layer of struggle. Also, many senior citizens she has interacted with do not favor openly addressing their mental health or even confronting their health problems. These ideas will definitely guide me while designing an application for seniors such as including an audio and adjusting font size features in the platform. In terms of the whole process of preparing and performing a contextual inquiry, I initially struggled with forming the tasks and questions because I wanted to keep it open-ended as possible while keeping in mind specific flaws I found from performing a heuristic evaluation of the other similar apps. During the interview, I had to ensure that I was tentatively listening as my sister would provide elaborate responses and sometimes answered questions I would have asked later in the interview. Something I had not expected was her showing a YouTube video when I asked how she would meditate. I expected an actual website or app so I had to improvise and alter my second task for her to be finding a tip to destress which I found also fit the conversation. For the future, I would create more hypothetical situations to ready myself but at the same time, by allowing me to alter my conversation accordingly, I felt the interview was also more genuine.
