# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 2: Usability Testing

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### Introduction 

The Mindful Living application is an app specifically on that iPad that provides meditation videos, podcasts, daily quotes, and relevant articles. To better assess the flaws and evaluate its functions to improve the user experience, a usability test was performed. This was done at my home out of convenience and due to current circumstances. This pilot test involved recording the user’s reactions and the application’s screen while the individual thinks aloud their thoughts, performs a series of tests, and answers the corresponding questions. A Zoom session was set up with a phone showing the face of my participant in the Zoom call and an iPad from which the participant would explore the app was set up to share its screen during the call. I set up my laptop properly to have the Zoom call to one-half of the page while the survey with the corresponding questions and speaker notes were on the other side.

### Methodology

Mindful Living Network was the app I had chosen out of the two platforms I had performed heuristic evaluations on because it possessed a higher average in severity ratings overall. 

From my heuristic evaluations, I have noted the following key usability flaws:
* Lack of cohesion in design with symbols and buttons
* Podcasts section was hard to follow
* Difficult to filter and search for videos in general


As a result, the three tasks as part of the study focuses on navigating through all the video-related pages while deciphering certain buttons’ functions. 

Specifically, for the first task, the user is asked to find all the Meditation videos, locate the number of videos that relate to the beach, find the video involving a particular Goddess, and return to the main page of the app after being led externally from the app. The Mindful Living Network app was quite flawed when it came to this user journey and accessibility because the heading font at the very top of the page was small and unnoticeable, there was no filter option, and external pages would inconvenience and confuse the user. 

The second task was navigating to the Stress Less Tips page to find two tips to help a supposed stressed  friend and then locating the official Stress Institute’s website which was through a button on the Stress Less Tips page to find services they provide.

The final task was locating a Podcast and adjusting the settings of the podcast as requested. The Podcasts page, like the Meditation Room page with videos, does not allow the user to filter through the many videos in any way. The Podcast video on the app itself also does not strongly communicate the time limit of the video, nor allow flexibility to the user to pause the video.

### Reflection 


After the pilot test, I had learned various perceptions about the app that I had not thought of. For example, the participant of my test mentioned how the title of the Stress Less Tips page was misleading being Stress Tips. She also reaffirmed some of the usability flaws in which the videos in both the Meditation Room and Podcasts pages lack a proper search and there were questionable symbols used such as the main page’s symbol with an arrow next to the words “Share the quote”. A difficulty I faced was restraining from giving my input or commenting on their actions on the specific tasks; I had to keep a straight face and try not to give my opinion when she was questioning out loud to herself and asked whether this was right. I did not want to disrupt the recording or workflow so better preparing and researching on how to properly reposed when the participant does know what to do would have been helpful. For the future, if this was app truly being analyzed again, having some more middle-aged or even older would have fit the user persona that this class’s project is focused on but like I said, working with what I had, there was no one a home who was both free and willing to partake in the test. Also, I noticed at times, the keyboard typing somewhat droned the voice of my participant so having a microphone of some sort would have been beneficial, but unfortunately, I did not have one handy. Overall, this was a great experience because I enjoyed noticing my participant’s subtle reactions to certain features of the app and also made me realize thatI may want to explore the user testing aspect more in terms of careers.
