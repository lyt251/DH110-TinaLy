# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 5: Low-Fidelity Prototype

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### Purpose

Be You is the title of my project, which focuses on the elderly population and improving their well-being specifically through meditation and simple to digest information/tips. From user testing, interviews, and persona and empathy mapping, I found that the elderly population had difficulty finding meditation videos and videos they last accessed, adjusting the video settings, and understanding health tips and content in English. 

The main features that the low-fidelity focuses are the following: 

* Settings to select language preference: this then enables many non-native elderly individuals to understand content
* Filter option for searching meditation videos: categories in addition to the ability of searching with any keywords
* Accessible video settings: adjusting volume, saving videos, skipping to a certain part of the video
* Articles with filter options 


Here is brief overview of the tasks that should be made based on the prototype:

* Check language preference 
* Find the recently uploaded video
(play video, save it, find captions for video, adjust volume)
* Go back to main page to find a reflection article


### Prototype

Starting at the Home page, one can access and change the language preference by pressing the gears icon in the lower left-hand corner to go the Settings page and from there, by clicking or tapping on the arrow downwards key below the “Language Preference” heading, one can then select another language other than English. One would need to press the save button in the lower right-hand corner in order to save the language preference or any changes to the Settings page. To go back to the Home page, there is an arrow head pointing to the left in the upper left-hand corner of the Settings page that should be tapped on.

Next, tap the Meditate button to be led to a list of meditation videos with a search bar and filter by key topics at the top. A saved video is listed first and recently uploaded videos are below it. Click on the recently uploaded video, press on the play icon, and then save the video using the bookmark symbol right below the video image. Click  on the “cc” in the lower right-hand corner of the video image to allow captions for the video. Tap on the speaker icon to adjust the volume of the video by sliding the current amount displayed in the measurement of volume to the desired volume magnitude.

Now, navigate back to the home page by clicking on the back arrow symbol in the upper left-hand corner of the Meditation Video page. There will then be a home symbol in the lower left-hand corner of the Meditate page; tap on this button to be led back to the Home page. Press on the Read button. Tap on the filter icon below the “Reflection Articles” title and select the Author button to categorize alphabetically the articles based on the author’s last name.

#### Check Language Preference

When the user first looked at the wireflow, they were confused where to start since I had not listed the Home page as the screen to the far left so it would have been better to perhaps switch the order of the Settings screen with the Home Page screen. This also gave me insight how the visual design of the Home page is significant and will need to be unique to provide sufficient color contrast so that users can differentiate between the Home page versus other secondary pages.  

#### Find Recently Uploaded Video (play video, save it, find captions for video, adjust volume)

Navigating to the page with all the meditation videos was an easy task for my participant but as they were worked up with analyzing and looking at the screens, they did not press on the first recently uploaded video like I requested by the video under the Saved category. In the end, they actually were not aware of the headings so to improve the design, there needs to be more spacing and when making the high-fidelity designs, the headings should possess a distinct font and color. When I mentioned playing the video and then saving it, they initially were not aware that they should be going to a similar screen after tapping on the play button, in which after tapping, the play icon should now be a pause one. Eventually though, they realized their mistake and I believe this had to do with how this low fidelity mockup lacks color and a design system so I will have to make sure that such buttons are made different from each other, for instance, through inverting the colors. When adding captions to the video, the participant had trouble finding the captions symbol in the lower right-hand corner of the video screen. They commented on how it was “too small.” To resolve this, the captions option can be more accessible through creating another button separate for it that is a similar size to the play icon button. 

#### Go Back to Main Page to Find a Reflection Article

Again, the user was worked up with focusing on the screens so did not play careful detail to how reflection articles should be sorted by authors’ last names and ended up saying how they would filter the articles through inputting how they would like the articles to be sorted for all options. They also commented on how there was a lack of confirmation to whether or not the articles would automatically change as these options to sort the articles a certain way are made. As an improvement, the sort options will specify Authors’ Last Names A -> Z and there will be a note pressing any filters will sort it automatically.

### Summary

Overall, this was definitely an interesting experience being able to physically see how the user would interact with the content of the application without taking into account any design measures. I do admit this was partly a setback because my participant was frequently bothered by the lack of color. I realized how some of the comments made by my user aligns with what we learned when performing a heuristic evaluation. For example, users want a sign of confirmation and should not be guessing certain actions. To have a seamless workflow, users should have cues and actions should be as effortless as possible by not requiring them to really remember information but rather easily recognize common elements. Through this, I was able to take note of several methods to tackle the visual design as the user expected certain cues to have happened or to have been included such as how reflection articles were sorted should be clearer to how when exactly these should sorted ie after they press a filter option or after confirming somehow.
