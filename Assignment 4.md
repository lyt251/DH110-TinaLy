# Practicing Mindfulness in the Elderly Population

## Assignment 4: UX Storytelling

Tina Ly | DH 110 | Spring 2021

### UX Storytelling

UX storytelling allows for better understanding of the context of the user. Without it, we may have a hard time placing ourselves in the shoes of the user. Feature improvements and ideas are then better tailored to the user experience. Hence, we can then create meaningful products. This technique allows for sharing of different point-of-views that might not have been realized before


### Personas and Empathy Maps

From what I learned from my user interviews and research, some elderly may not favor going to the doctor so I focused on two contrasting personalities and views on healthcare but they possess the lack of technological experience.

### Scenarios and User Journeys

#### Twain and Meditation Video Search and Saving Video

Twain had just visited the doctor who advised her of making sure she was being active and positive everyday. The doctor also suggested that whenever she felt she had a lot on her mind, she should try meditating to clear her thoughts. Twain is a pancreatic cancer survivor but it has only been just six months since the projected date of her passing away. Six months ago, she was able to get a donor and the transplant was then performed immediately. Dwelling on the past quite often, she is genuinely grateful but also cannot help but think about what could have happened. Last night, she finished a delicious chocolate cake to mark Benny’s, her dog’s, birthday. Now, her mind was full of thoughts on how she should exercise and try meditating like the doctor advised. 

She pulled out her iPad; Be You was the app downloaded which is one of the few applications that is free and has meditation videos she could easily filter and save. Unlike the Mindful Living app, Be You was an app that is able to make out all the words on the main page. Before entering the main page, the app reads in big words, “You can do it!” Each time she entered the app, there would be encouraging words which always made her day. There are clear, visibly sized buttons to navigate to at the main page: Meditate, Read, Listen. Whenever she had previously clicked on the Meditation Room page of the Mindful Living app, she had to reread the directions at the top and squint which always ended up not helping. Easily clicking on the Meditate button on the Be You app, Twain easily finds the video she had saved and watched last week about releasing one’s thoughts as if by a mountain stream. It was at the very top of all videos. As she clicked on it, she was then navigated to a page that transitioned in from the left that clearly displayed the topic of the video’s name which filled at least a quarter of the page and the options to pause, play, navigate to a certain part of the video, and save the video were all below it, spaced evenly. The play button centered with an icon that was recognizable alongside it was the pause button. The usual slider for the progress of videos was displayed below these two buttons and was not necessarily thin but reasonably big for Twain to see. As she dragged the circle that indicated where the video currently was towards the end, she made out the time that appeared on the page as an overlay. Whenever she was not on the progress bar, the overlay disappeared. There was also a bookmark/ribbon in the upper right-hand corner of the page that was clearly filled in when she had saved it last week. She finishes this video and then decides to find another video but on another topic. There is also an arrow symbol pointing to the left in the opposite corner of the location of the bookmark. She clicks on it and returns to the page with all the videos displayed. She is able to filter through all the videos with the option at the top that says Filter. When she clicks on this, Twain is amazed to find that there are other clearly labeled categories as buttons such as Breathing, Relaxation, Reflection, Energy. Clicking on Reflection she navigates to a similar formatted page as the page with all the videos but can clearly see that these videos are related to Reflection and is able to save the third video without necessarily clicking on the video because there is a bookmark option for each video displayed.

Before discovering Be You, she could not save any videos on the Mindful Living app and whenever she wanted to find a specific video or the last video she clicked on, she would always scroll to the very end of the page and then back up again. Becoming frustrated, she found it difficult to navigate to the video she last watched and her eyes would become irritated from the top bright golden banner which contrasts with the rest of the page. She would wonder why the font size of the letters are so small and hard to read and whether she would need a trip to the optometrist. Twain was not also able to make out the subtle white lines that divided the background image of each video from another image in the Meditation Room page of the Mindful Living app.

#### Nguyen and Article Resources

Nguyen is not the type of person to open up about his feelings nor health; he strongly believes in being able to do things for himself. He has been enjoying reading and analyzing research articles on his own time to better his health but the search has been limited and takes forever. He usually tries to search the web for something but knowing which words to exactly type in English is hard. He can read and write fluently in Vietnamese but as an immigrant, English is ultimately a language he has to constantly catch himself on. Being on the battlefield has left a lot of scars mentally and physically so he has been particularly interested in learning how to let his mind go and wander to achieve a certain clean mental state. Just yesterday, he had been trying to search for meditation articles on Google and he clicked on the first link Mindful website but there were so many articles and Nguyen was confused on the many options for menu’s dropdowns. When on the main page, there were a lot of pop up messages and sidebar advertisements that were distracting. Nguyen saw the block of text in black letters and he could not get the page to zoom in so he could try to read it. With his face an inch away from the computer screen, about each word that he was able to read he basically glanced and skipped over because he simply did not know what it meant. Looking for perhaps a Vietnamese translation, he could not find any option besides more English words.

Now though, after discovering Be You, he can plan his health journey with the reading guides and read health-related and specifically mental health and meditation articles without the hassle and effort of searching . The main page of the Be You app has a settings icon in the lower left-hand corner with options to change language preference and luckily for Nguyen, Vietnamese is an option. He is now able understand and easily read the reasonably-sized titles and button options. After he changed the language preference to Vietnamese from settings, he is led back to the main page with the buttons: Meditate, Read, Listen now in Vietnamese and there is also a button in the upper-right hand corner to be able to have the options be read out loud. An overlay with instructions and audio on how to navigate the page emerges and he is amazed by how simple the page is with everything he needs. When he presses on the Read button, there is a filter in the upper-right hand corner to narrow his search based on the subject with example subjects listed that are most popular and recent. All articles are in Vietnamese and portrayed in rectangles with the title and snippet of article displayed and the article can be read by an audio which is found when he presses to view the full article. He can gain a glimpse of each article’s main idea which further helps him find the article he is looking for. A bookmark save option on each article listed allows him to save articles for future reads.
